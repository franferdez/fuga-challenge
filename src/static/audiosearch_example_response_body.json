And what are they trying to tell us with that purr (you know the one)? \n\nWe've got the answers -- cat behavior expert Mikel Delgado helps us decode cat quirks and producer Sanden Totten teaches us what's behind cats' glowing eyes.

      "description": "With Yahoo’s $1.1 billion purchase of blogging platform Tumblr, this week’s podcast will focus on the future of the two companies and how, or if, they’ll survive the transition. Will Yahoo become the youthful information hub it struggles to be, and will Tumblr finally become profitable without alienating its users? Then, in the wake of the Justice Department’s acquisition of AP phone records, newly revealed court documents show that the DOJ investigated Fox News Chief Washington Correspondent James Rosen as a “co-conspirator” in a case against a State Department adviser accused of leaking classified information. We’ll follow up on our conversation from last week on the balance between the First Amendment and the need to ensure national security. Finally, we’ll chat with our special guest, Ben Huh of Cheezburger, on why cats dominate the Internet. The roundtable will be hosted by MediaShift’s Mark Glaser, with regulars Ana Marie Cox from The Guardian, Mónica Guzmán from the Seattle Times and GeekWire, and Andrew Lih from USC.",
